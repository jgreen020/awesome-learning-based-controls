## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request and the different ways you can do that.

## Contribution Reccomendations
### Addition of Background Material
- Addition of background material is not reccomended, as other lists generally cover these topics more comprehensively
- Entries in background sections should be broadly relevant across the LBC field, useful as starting points for jumping into advanced LBC methods, or of broad interest to those in the LBC field.
- Title your pull request: 'Add Background [Topic Name]'
  - EX: Add Background Trust Region Optimization
### Addition of LBC Materials
- This list is not indendendend to be a comprehensive list of every paper having to do with LBC, it is instead a curation of specific resources and noteworthy papers, so ensure new additions are noteworthy 
- Ensure materials are not duplicates (with exception)
- Ensure additions are in the appropriate section
- Title your pull request: 'Add Material [Material Name]'
  - EX: Add Material Generative Adversarial Networks
### Addition of Projects
- Use the following formatting when adding your project to the Applications section:
```
- ***Insert Paper Title***:
  - Brief Description [[Paper](Insert Paper DOI)][[Repo](Insert Link GitHub Repository)]
```
- Keep your description to 1-2 sentances and include both the application area and the title of applied methods.
- Title your pull request: 'Add Project [1st author last name] [year]'
  - EX: Add Project Colwell 2025
